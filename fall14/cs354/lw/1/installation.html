<H1>Instructions for Installing Ruby on Your Machine:</H1>
	<p>
	Congratulations!! By choosing to install Ruby, you have taken the first step<br>
	toward become a better developer and human being!.  Say goodbye to your friends,<br>
	your family, and even your dog.  They are now obsolete.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs,<br>
	and Linus Torvald; these are just a few of the names that will be forgotten after<br>
	you ascend to your proper place as the greatest developer who has ever lived!  But<br>
	before any of this can happen, you need to get Ruby installed on your machine.<br>
	<h5>FEAR NOT! FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND YOUR JOURNEY TO GREATNESS WILL BE WELL UNDERWAY.</h5>
	</p>

	<h3>Instructions for Windows:</h3>
	<p>
	1. Go to <a href="rubyinstaller.org">rubyinstaller.org</a>.<br>
	2. Click "Download" at the top of the screen.<br>
	3. After the download is completed, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.<br>
	</p>

	<h3>Instructions for Linux:</h3>
	<p>
	Execute one of the following commands based upon which distribution of Linux you are using:
	<br>
	<h4>Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint:</h4>
	<code>sudo apt-get install ruby</code>
	<br>
	<h4>CentOS, Fedora, RHEL:</h4>
	<code>sudo yum install ruby</code>
	<br>
	<h4>Gentoo:</h4>
	<code>sudo emerge dev-lang/ruby</code>
	<br>
	<h4>Arch Linux:</h4>
	<code>sudo pacman -S ruby</code>
	</p>

	<h3>Instructions for OS X:</h3>
	<p>
	Ruby comes pre-installed on OS X.  It is possible that it is an older version though.<br>
	The recommended approach is to use HomeBrew to install a newer version of Ruby.<br>
	If you already have HomeBrew installed, continue to the install instructions, otherwise<br>
	here are the instructions to install HomeBrew:<br>

	<h4>HomeBrew Install Instructions:</h4>
	Execute the following command from the terminal (note this will work with the pre-installed version of Ruby):
	<br><br>
	<code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code>
	<br><br>
	To install the latest version of Ruby, execute the following command from the terminal:
	<br><br>
	<code>brew install ruby</code>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Way to go! You have now successfully installed Ruby on your machine.  Let someone try to stop you now.<br>
	Your computer will fear you, your associates will envy you, and the world will be better for the code<br>
	that you will write.  You have negated the need for testing in any way, shape, or form.  You are now incapable of writing<br>
	code that is less than perfect.  Godspeed on your journey to greatness and likely immortality.<br>
	</p>
