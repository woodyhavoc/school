OVERVIEW:

 This program reads NFA information from a file and converts it into
 a DFA.  After that, it tests a set of strings to see if they are valid
 against the DFA.

INCLUDED FILES:

 FADriver.java: The driver class which contains the main method.
 
 FiniteAutomata.java: Creates a FiniteAutomata object which reads a file and passes information
 					  to a DFA object.
 
 DFA.java: Generates a DFA with the information it is given, then tests strings against that DFA. 


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 To build this program enter the following command:
 
 	javac FADriver.java
 	
 To run it enter the following command:
 
 	java FADriver <file name>
 
PROGRAM DESIGN:

 This program accepts an input file which contains NFA information.  It then
 processes this file, and generates an equivalent DFA.  After this DFA is created,
 a series of test strings are processed to see if they will be accepted by the DFA.
 After all of this has been completed, information about the DFA will be printed to
 the screen.  This information includes the DFA states, transitions, and the results
 of the tests. 

TESTING:

 To test this program, I used the sample NFA information that I was given.  In addition
 to this, I made some of my own NFAs, determined the equivalent DFA, and ran a file
 through my program to ensure it functioned properly.

DISCUSSION:

 I did not encounter too many problems while writing this program.  I had a pretty solid
 understanding of the NFA and DFA before I began writing it.  The only difficulties I faced
 were in how to implement the solution.  After I spent some time thinking about it though,
 the implementation I ended up choosing became apparent to me as the correct route.
