OVERVIEW:

 Concisely explain what the program does.


INCLUDED FILES:

 List the files required for the project with a brief
 explanation of why each is included.


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 Give the command for compiling the program, the command
 for running the program, and any usage instructions the
 user needs.
 
 These are command-line instructions for a system like onyx.
 They have nothing to do with Eclipse or any other IDE. They
 must be specific - assume the user has Java installed, but
 has no idea how to compile or run a Java program from the
 command-line.
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 Give a design overview of the program. Explain the main
 concepts. Explain the main responsibilities of each class.
 Explain how the classes work together to achieve the program goals.
 
 This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
 understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
 would want to know.
 

TESTING:

 How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
 requirements? Can your program handle bad input? Is your program 
 idiot-proof? How do you know? What are the known issues / bugs
 remaining in your program?


DISCUSSION:
 
 Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
 and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
 and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you 
 fix them?
 
 What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
 that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
 
 
EXTRA CREDIT:

 If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
 be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.
